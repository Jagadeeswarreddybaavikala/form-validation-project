This project is a **client-side form validation system** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It validates user input in a web form (such as name, email, password, phone, etc.) and displays clear error messages to ensure data is entered correctly before submission.

This project was built as part of my **internship**, focusing on writing clean, reusable validation logic and improving user experience.
